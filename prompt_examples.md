# ðŸ“„ Prompt Examples â€“ GenAI Week 3

Here are 3 prompt examples I explored during Week 1 & 2 while experimenting with ChatGPT and other LLM tools.

## ðŸ”¹ Prompt 1: Text Generation (Creative Writing)

**Prompt:**  
*"Write a short story about a robot that discovers it can paint using only recycled materials."*

**Purpose:**  
To test the modelâ€™s ability to generate creative and imaginative content based on an abstract theme.

**What I Learned:**  
The prompt encourages vivid storytelling and shows how LLMs can create context-rich narratives with minimal input.

## ðŸ”¹ Prompt 2: Code Generation (Python)

**Prompt:**  
*"Generate Python code to clean a CSV file by removing null values and converting date columns to datetime format."*

**Purpose:**  
To automate a common data cleaning task using GenAI.

**What I Learned:**  
ChatGPT provides ready-to-use, functional code when the prompt is clear and specifies the desired format.

## ðŸ”¹ Prompt 3: Summarization

**Prompt:**  
*"Summarize the key points of the YouTube video: 'GitHub Crash Course for Beginners' in 5 bullet points."*

**Purpose:**  
To extract useful, concise information from long-form content.

**What I Learned:**  
Prompting LLMs to summarize helps turn raw content (videos, articles) into digestible learning notes.

## ðŸ”¹ Prompt 4: Using Tools with Agents (Wikipedia Search)

**Prompt:**  
*"Using the Wikipedia tool, find a brief summary of who Alan Turing was and explain his contribution to computer science in simple terms."*

**Purpose:**  
To test the use of **external tools (Wikipedia)** via agents to fetch real-world data and present it in a simplified format.

**What I Learned:**  
- Agents can automatically decide when to call a tool (like Wikipedia) to retrieve up-to-date or factual information.
- The model can combine retrieved data with natural language explanations to enhance the response.
- Itâ€™s powerful for building **question-answering systems** or **knowledge assistants**.

**Tool Used:**  
Wikipedia API via LangChain agent

**Expected Behavior:**  
- The agent uses the Wikipedia search tool to find the page on **Alan Turing**.
- Summarizes the key contributions and simplifies the explanation.
